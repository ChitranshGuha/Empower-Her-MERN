2.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in both your `client` and `server` directories (or at the root if configured differently). Add necessary environment variables such as:

  * **Browse Job Listings:** All users can view available job postings on the platform.

### Enhanced User Communication & Feedback

  * **Notification System:** Develop dedicated notification pages to keep users informed about new job matches, application updates, platform announcements, and other relevant information.
